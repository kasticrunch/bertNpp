Monthly outage reports of U.S. nuclear power plants have been inputted into a structured database. Each planned or unplanned outage has various data fields describing the power plant state, including written documentation on what caused the shutdown, how long the shutdown was, etc. This project looks to classify written outage reports into classes of outage severity to provide better approximations of severity in future unseen outage reports. Two methods will investigated, the fine-tuning of BERT and a complement naive bayes classifier. This repository focuses on the BERT methodology.
